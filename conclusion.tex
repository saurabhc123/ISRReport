\chapter{Conclusion}

In this report, we have clarified the problem, goal, and execution plan of the
document classification team.

To summarize, we will classify the tweet and web-page collection based on the
association rule-based approach.
In addition to the algorithmic aspect, we will also try to reduce the
classification time by exploiting the benefit of in-memory data analytics
framework, e.g., Apache Spark.
